Solutions for [Advent Of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016), written in F#. Automatic solutions for some days is missing since some solutions required manual work by hand.

Run the code by opening the solution in Visual Studio and running the _Aoc16.FinishedDays.Test_ tests through Test Explorer.

Or check out the solution code inside _Aoc16.FinishedDays_.

Each day was originally coded inside the _Aoc16.ActiveDay/Program.fs_ for regular debugging, then renamed and moved to _FinishedDays_.
